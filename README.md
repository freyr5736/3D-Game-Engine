# 3D Game Engine

Welcome to the **3D Game Engine** project! This is a simple 3D game engine developed in C++ using Visual Studio as the IDE. The primary goal of this project is to learn and understand the fundamentals of game engine development with the help of YouTube tutorials.

## Overview

This project serves as a learning platform where I explore various aspects of game engine development, including rendering, physics, input handling, and more. Itâ€™s a work in progress, and as I continue to learn, I plan to add more features and optimizations.

## Features

- **3D Rendering:** Basic rendering capabilities using C++.
- **Physics Engine:** Simple physics simulations.
- **Input Handling:** Basic input handling for controlling objects in the scene.
- **Texture Management:** Ability to create and manage multiple textures.
- **Lighting:** Playing with different types of source lighting.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Visual Studio:** This project was developed using Visual Studio. You will need it to compile and run the project.
- **C++ Compiler:** Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed and configured with Visual Studio.
